## Study Summary

This study examined the mental health of 1,231 nurses and physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic in hospitals across Tehran, Kerman, and Golpayegan (2021-2022). Using the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) and K-means clustering, researchers identified distinct mental health clusters, with one cluster showing the highest mental distress scores, primarily consisting of females, bachelor's degree holders, and nurses.

## Key Findings

- Identified three distinct mental health clusters among hospital staff
- Cluster two showed the highest mental distress scores
- Anxiety/insomnia was a significant concern in the high-distress cluster
- Recommendations include management plans such as redistributing night shifts
